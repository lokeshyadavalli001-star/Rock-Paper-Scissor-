# Rock-Paper-Scissor-
A classic Rock Paper Scissors game implemented in Python. Play against the computer in this simple yet entertaining command-line game.
This project is a Command Line Interface (CLI) implementation of the classic two-player game, Rock-Paper-Scissors, built using **Python 3.x**. The game pits the user against a computer opponent that generates moves randomly.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate foundational programming concepts from the subject syllabus, including:
* **Modular Programming** using functions.
* **Control Flow** (e.g., `if-else` statements) for game rule implementation.
* **Input/Output Handling** and **Validation**.

##  Features

This implementation is structured around three core functional modules:

1.  **Input/Output Interface:** Handles all user prompts, move input, and display of game results and scores.
2.  **Game Logic:** Contains the core comparison logic to accurately determine the winner of each round based on the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.
3.  **Score Tracking:** Manages and persists the player's and computer's scores for the duration of the current game session.
4.  **Robust Input Validation:** Ensures the system only accepts 'r', 'p', or 's' inputs, preventing crashes from invalid user data.

##  Technologies and Tools Used

| Component | Tool / Language | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Language** | Python 3.x | Core language for the subject implementation. |
| **Concepts Applied** | Functions, `if/elif/else`, Dictionaries (for score), `random` library. | Directly applying syllabus concepts. |
| **Version Control** | Git / GitHub | Used for tracking development history and final submission. |
